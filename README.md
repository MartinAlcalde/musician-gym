# Musician Gym

**Functional ear training focused on scale degrees and tonal context.**

Musician Gym helps you recognize scale degrees by their function within a key. Instead of abstract interval training, you learn to hear notes in harmonic context using I-IV-V-I cadences.

## Key Features

**üéß Auto Mode** - Passive training with automatic cadence playback. Practice while commuting or doing other activities.

**üéÆ Remote Control Support** - Use Bluetooth gamepads, cheap USB camera shutters (~$2), or any HID device. Practice hands-free from across the room.

**üéº Functional Training** - Learn scale degrees in tonal context rather than isolated intervals.

**üåô Dark Theme** - Easy on the eyes for practice in bed or low-light environments.

**‚å®Ô∏è Custom Key Mapping** - Map scale degrees to any keyboard keys or Bluetooth device buttons for personalized practice.
